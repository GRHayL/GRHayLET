==========
1. Purpose
==========

GRHayLHD implements a general relativistic hydrodynamics evolution code using the
General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL) via the GRHayLib thorn.  It
supports most features of the library, including all Con2Prim routines, piecewise
parabolic reconstruction, HLLE Riemann solver, and both hybrid polytropic and
tabulated equations of state.

The thorn also supports the ability to perturb the initial data and/or to perturb
the conservative variables at every timestep. These features can assist with debugging
or assessing the sensitivity of any code changes to round-off level effects.
