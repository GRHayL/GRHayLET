Note          : This version of IllinoisGRMHD is built on GRHayL, which is
                itself derived from the original version of the thorn.
                IllinoisGRMHD is based on the GRMHD code of the
                Illinois Numerical Relativity group, written by Matt Duez, Yuk
                Tung Liu, and Branson Stephens (original version), and then
                developed primarily by Zachariah Etienne, Yuk Tung Liu,
                and Vasileios Paschalidis.

==========
1. Purpose
==========

IllinoisGRMHD solves the equations of general relativistic magneto-
hydrodynamics (GRMHD) using a high-resolution shock capturing scheme
and is built on the General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL)
via the GRHayLib thorn. This library derives many of its core algorithms
from the original IllinoisGRMHD thorn, which is itself a rewrite of the
Illinois Numerical Relativity group's GRMHD  code. 

This thorn supports most  of GRHayL's features including all Con2Prim
routines, piecewise parabolic reconstruction, HLLE Riemann solver, and
both hybrid polytropic and tabulated equations of state.

IllinoisGRMHD evolves the vector potential A_{\mu} (on staggered grids) 
instead of the magnetic fields (B^i) directly, to guarantee that the 
magnetic fields will remain divergenceless even at AMR boundaries. On 
uniform resolution grids, this vector potential formulation produces 
results equivalent to those generated using the standard, staggered 
flux-CT scheme. This scheme is based on that of Del Zanna (2003, see
below OPTIONAL CITATION #1).

===================
1. Modelled Systems
===================

The various incarnations of IllinoisGRMHD and its predecessors have been
used to model a variety of systems, including
1) Magnetized circumbinary disk accretion onto binary black holes
2) Magnetized black hole--neutron star mergers
3) Magnetized Bondi flow, Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton accretion
4) White dwarf--neutron star mergers

IllinoisGRMHD is particularly good at modeling GRMHD flows into black holes
without the need for excision. It also applies a check that validates the
physicality of conservative variables prior to primitive inversion and
moves them into the physical range if they become unphysical.
