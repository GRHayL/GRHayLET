1. Purpose
==========

GRHayLHD implements a general relativistic hydrodynamics evolution code using the
General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL) via the GRHayLib thorn.  This
thorn is identical to the GRHayLHD thorn, but for use with CarpetX. It supports
most  of GRHayL's features including all Con2Prim routines, piecewise
parabolic reconstruction, HLLE Riemann solver, and both hybrid polytropic and
tabulated equations of state.

The thorn also supports the ability to perturb the initial data and/or to perturb
the conservative variables at every timestep. These features can assist with debugging
or assessing the sensitivity of any code changes to round-off level effects.

Currently, this thorn can only run on the host and not on the GPU device because
of limitations in the GRHayLib thorn.
