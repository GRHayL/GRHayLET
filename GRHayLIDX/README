==========
1. Purpose
==========

GRHayLIDX provides several simple initial data (ID) setups for GR(M)HD systems
using the General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL). This includes

1) all five Balsara tests (simple/hybrid EOS only)
2) static equilibrium (simple/hybrid EOS only)
3) shock tube (simple/hybrid EOS only)
4) sound wave (simple/hybrid EOS only)
5) isotropic gas (tabulated EOS only)
6) constant density sphere (tabulated EOS only)

Initialization of the magnetic fields is optional and can be controlled at
runtime.

Additionally, the thorn can impose beta equilibrium on initial data for the
tabulated EOS. It can also compute the entropy from the other quantities for
any EOS. These features do not require that GRHayLIDX be used as the ID source
and can be used with any ID thorn so long as GRHayLib is properly initialized
and the ID schedules its routines in the expected HydroBaseX_InitialData bin.

Currently, this thorn can only run on the host and not on the GPU device because
of limitations in the GRHayLib thorn.
